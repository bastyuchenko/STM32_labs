# Timer Interrupt
A Timer Interrupt is a mechanism used in computer applications to run specific functions asynchronously at regular intervals.

## Overview
A timer interrupt is a hardware-triggered event that temporarily pauses the normal execution of a program to handle time-sensitive tasks. When a timer reaches a predetermined value or condition, it generates an interrupt signal that prompts the CPU to execute a specific interrupt service routine (ISR).

## Key Components

### Timer Hardware
- Counter register that increments or decrements at a fixed rate
- Compare/Match register to set the target value
- Prescaler to divide the input clock frequency
- Control registers for configuration
- Interrupt flags and enable bits

### Software Components
- Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)
- Interrupt vector table entry
- Interrupt initialization code
- Priority configuration

## Working Mechanism

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Configure timer parameters (prescaler, period)
   - Enable timer interrupt
   - Set interrupt priority
   - Define ISR function
   - Start timer

2. **Operation Phase**
   - Timer counts based on clock input
   - When counter matches target value:
     - Hardware sets interrupt flag
     - CPU completes current instruction
     - CPU saves context
     - CPU jumps to ISR
     - ISR executes
     - CPU restores context
     - Program continues from where it was interrupted

## Common Applications

- Periodic task scheduling
- Time measurement
- PWM generation
- Timeout monitoring
- Real-time control systems
- Software debouncing
- System tick generation

## Advantages

- Precise timing control
- Non-blocking operation
- Hardware-based timing accuracy
- Efficient for periodic tasks
- Reduced CPU polling overhead

## Considerations

- ISR should be kept short and efficient
- Interrupt priorities must be carefully planned
- Shared resources need proper protection
- Interrupt latency affects timing precision
- Nested interrupts require careful management

## Example Code Structure

```c
// Timer Interrupt initialization
void Timer_Init(void) {
    // Configure timer
    // Set prescaler and period
    // Enable interrupt
}

// Interrupt Service Routine
void Timer_IRQHandler(void) {
    // Clear interrupt flag
    // Execute time-critical code
    // Update variables if needed
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep ISRs as short as possible
2. Use volatile for shared variables
3. Avoid blocking operations in ISRs
4. Handle interrupt flags properly
5. Consider interrupt priorities
6. Use interrupt safe operations
7. Properly protect shared resources

## Limitations

- Interrupt latency
- Context switching overhead
- Potential for interrupt conflicts
- Resource sharing complexities
- Debug complexity
- Stack usage considerations
